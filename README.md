This repository will be a simple Coin-Tracker for the most important Crypto Currencies.
It is written with Typescript (Next.js) and will use the Crypto Compare API.

It's purpose is to show current Crypto Prices, Charts and detailed information about the Crypto Currencies, to give a quick overview of the current state of the Crypto Market.
We try to focus on solid Coins with a solid Technology and a good Team behind it. In the future we will try explain more of the technical details of the Coins.
